# commitstrip-downloader

Simple downloader in python for the commitstrip.com website

This script should be seen as an web-scraping exercise I did after reading the great book "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python", by Al Sweigart (@asweigart).

An online version can be looked at here: http://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter11/

The book example is about a xkcd downloader: I adapted it to www.commitstrip.com.
